# mask_detection_and_social_distance

This is a project that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track people in a live video feed, as well as to detect whether they are wearing masks or not. The project uses a combination of the Single Shot Detector (SSD) object detection model, a facial recognition model, and a mask detection model to achieve this functionality. It calculates the distance between them to determine whether they are standing too close to each other and potentially violating social distancing guidelines. It can process a live video feed from a camera or a video file, and it has the option to output the processed video to a file or to display it on the screen.
